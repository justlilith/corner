Move, resize, scale, zoom and layer them freely, to create a nice moodboard for whatever you're working on.\r\n\r\nIt's written with SvelteKit and hosted on Netlify.\r\n\r\nLive link: [Polyref](https://www.polyref.cc/)\r\n\r\nGitHub: [justlilith/polyreference](https://github.com/justlilith/polyreference/)",
