Welcome to the new version of my site. I've migrated the CMS and UI from Tumblr to a custom solution. Right now, this site is made via:\n\n- SvelteKit\n- Hugo\n- Marked\n- Netlify\n\nI write journal entries in Markdown, which is wrapped by Hugo into JSON. SvelteKit serves that JSON via a Netlify functions endpoint. Next, the static SvelteKit site rips the Markdown from the JSON, at which point marked renders it into HTML.\n\nSo, I write an entry, run Hugo, push to GitHub, and the site is updated (Netlify is the backend for everything and runs via repo triggers). ezpz. ðŸ’™"
