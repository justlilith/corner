  "description":"\r\n# Walk Rates: Answering a Fun Question\r\n\r\nHaven’t we all bet our friends we could make a journey on the promise of tacos alone? What if you made it eating nothing but tacos? How many tacos would you need?\r\n\r\nWalk Rates answers those questions. It’s a mobile app built with a combination of React, Node.js, and Heroku, but all the details are on GitHub.\r\n\r\nNote: This project has been sunset.\r\n\r\nGitHub: [justlilith/walkrates](https://href.li/?https://github.com/justlilith/walkrates)",
