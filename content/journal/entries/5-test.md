# Test From Hugo

Hey. We worked it out. Now all posts will be written in Markdown, parsed by Hugo, and since SvelteKit uses a static adapter, rebuilt by SvelteKit. This means that writing a blog post will be as easy as ever â€” plus, these posts can go anywhere Markdown can. There's nothing locking them into my site. I'm really glad about that.
