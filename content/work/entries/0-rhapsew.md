# Rhapsew

Rhapsew is a web-native, CAD-oriented patternmaking application for sewists and artists. It features a point-and-click user interface and cross-software SVG output (for input into other sewing, patternmaking, and CAD software).

Rhaosew is written with TypeScript and Imba, which allows the software to run in any modern browser.
