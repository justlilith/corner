# Walk Rates: Answering a Fun Question

Haven’t we all bet our friends we could make a journey on the promise of tacos alone? What if you made it eating nothing but tacos? How many tacos would you need?

Walk Rates answers those questions. It’s a mobile app built with a combination of React, Node.js, and Heroku, but all the details are on GitHub.

The app is live! And I’m still making changes, so check back often.
