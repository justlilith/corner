# A Softer Space

A Softer Space is a calming area to vent your thoughts, as if texting a friend.

It uses a familiar, text-based UI, and allows you to download your chats (so that you could, for example, send them to a therapist), as well as login to save them, which allows you to access your chats from any device.

It's written with SvelteKit and hosted on Netlify. For some elements, p5.js is used.
