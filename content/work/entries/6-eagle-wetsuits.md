# Eagle Wetsuits

In short: my time as Eagle's art director was characterized by CAD-driven apparel design, pattern research and development, branding and marketing, client-focused custom products, and a lot of fun.

I started at Eagle Wetsuits as a graphic designer. I learned to create stunning and beautiful artwork with an eye for our clients, on a range of unique products that suited their lifestyle. However, I then started to research sewing and patternmaking, to better suit our clients' tailoring needs. As a tailor, I learned how people are impacted by not only the visual design of their athletic wear, but also the functional characteristics.

This led to studying CAD software and digital tailoring to improve products across our market base and client needs. This also helped us expand our custom offerings and satisy market needs on a rolling schedule.

I loved my time as Eagle's art director, and I love that I was able to touch the lives of so many of our clients.
